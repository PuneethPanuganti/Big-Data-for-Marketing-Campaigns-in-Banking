The outcome of the campaign is significantly influenced by the customer's account balance.Â 

Future correspondence should target those clients since people with high account balances are more likely to sign up for term deposits.

Campaign results are also impacted by the customer's age. The focus of future marketing campaigns should be on consumers between the ages of 30 and 50.

The quantity of client interactions during the campaign is also crucial. No more than four interactions with the customer should be made.
